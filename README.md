# Comparing NumPy and PyArma
```comparison.py``` compares NumPy and PyArmadillo implementations
of an acoustic localisation formulation as in Spiesberger & Wahlberg 2002 JASA. 

The code is constructed to be as similar as possible to ease comparison. 

## Results

| Implementation | Time per run (micro-s) |   OS |
|----------------|------------------------|------|
|   NumPy        |     ~820               | Win10|
|   PyArmadillo  |     ~120               | Win10|
